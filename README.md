# Min-Heap-Implementation-Using-a-Vector

This code is a Min-Heap implemantation using a vector. A min-heap is a tree-based data
structure where each node has a lesser or equal value to all its children nodes. To do this, the code 
has implementations of the insert() and removeMin() functions which maintain the heap property with the 
private helper functions siftUp() and siftDown(). Additionally there is a parameterized constructor that 
takes a vector; this function is implemented to build the heap from the bottom-up (insert() should not be called).
